Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Access the uploaded audio files to test the working of the model. These audio files are not part of the training dataset, so they are entirely new for the model.
2. Download the repository and access the audio files dataset.
3. The web application can be hosted using platforms like Google Cloud Services, Render, Heroku, PythonAnywhere, Microsoft Azure, AWS, and others.
4. Upload one of the audio files from the provided dataset. Files with initials "kk" represent spoof samples, while files without initials are bonafide samples. Understanding this distinction will help you assess the accuracy of the model.
5. The result will appear on the result page, providing the prediction for the uploaded audio.

Web App Deployment:
I have deployed my Web App using Microsoft Azure, and you can access it via the following link to try out the working of my web app and check the modelâ€™s accuracy:

Note: Since the application is hosted on a free-tier service, users may experience higher loading times and occasional performance limitations.
Since the web app is hosted on a public platform, users will not have access to the Write and Rewrite API operations that occur in the backend, involving the Chrome Storage API, which handles data storage.


Disclaimer:
The web application is currently in the development phase. As such, its predictions should not be entirely relied upon, as the model has been trained on a relatively small dataset of approximately 11,000 samples. To improve accuracy and provide more reliable audio predictions, a larger and more diverse dataset is required. Ongoing improvements and further training with more data are essential for optimal performance in real-world applications.
The current accuracy of the model is around 97%.
