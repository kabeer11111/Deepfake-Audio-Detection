As we know we can't host a website that has a back end on Github, as github is just used to host static sites.
Step by Step Execution:-
1. Access the uploaded audio files to test the working of the model.(These audio files are not used to train the model so they are completely new for it).
2. Download the reposatory and access the audio dataset.
3. One can host it using platforms such as Google Cloud Services, Render, Heroku, Pythonanywhere, Microsft Azure, Amazon Web Services etc.
4. Upload one of the file from the provided audio files dataset, the one with the initials as "kk" are the spoof samples where as the one without initials are bonafide samples, keeping this in mind will help you to understand the accuracy of the model.
5. Result will be appeared on the result page.

I have deployed my Web App using Microsoft Azure, one can acceess the same from the below link and try-out the uploaded audio files in my Repository to check the accuracy of the Web App/Model:-

Disclaimer:-
Note: The web application is currently in the development phase. As such, its predictions should not be relied upon entirely at this stage, as the model has been trained on a relatively small dataset of approximately 11,000 samples. To achieve higher accuracy and more reliable validation for audio predictions, a larger and more diverse dataset is required. Further improvements and training with more data are necessary for optimal performance in real-world applications.
The current accuracy of the model is around 97%.
